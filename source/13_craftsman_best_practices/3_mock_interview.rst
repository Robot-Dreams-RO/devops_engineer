13.2 Interview Preparation: DevOps Engineer
###########################################

.. note:: Interview are popularity contest you don't have to know everything but you have to make a good impression.

============
Who are you?
============

.. note:: Most of us, when asked to talk about ourselves, we tend to ramble on and on about our lives and careers. This is a mistake. The interviewer is not interested in your life story; they are interested in what you can do for them and their company. So, when asked to talk about yourself, you should focus on your professional skills and accomplishments, not your personal life.

Question: Who are you?
Answer: I'm Claudiu, DevOps/Data engineer with almost 15 years of experiense, focused on make data and software development stupid and easy to you. My goal is to automate everything and challange the status quo, while keeping the business running, the customers happy, and empowring the team to take data driven decisions.

But, this feels fake. Because it is. The entire process is fake. You're an actor at his casting aution.

By being prepared you can always stir the conversation to your advantage.
