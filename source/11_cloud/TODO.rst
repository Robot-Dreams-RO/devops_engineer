1. What distinguishes public clouds from private clouds?

    Correct Answer: a. A private cloud is dedicated to a single organization, offering exclusive access and control, whereas a public cloud provides services to multiple tenants and is accessible to anyone.
    
    Explanation: Private clouds are designed for exclusive use by a single organization, providing greater control over data, security, and compliance. Public clouds, on the other hand, are owned and operated by third-party providers and offer services to multiple customers, benefiting from economies of scale.

2. How do IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS differ from each other?

    Correct Answer: a. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, Platform as a Service (PaaS) offers hardware and software tools over the internet, and Software as a Service (SaaS) delivers software applications over the internet.

    Explanation: IaaS provides fundamental compute, network, and storage resources on-demand, on a pay-as-you-go basis. PaaS provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure. SaaS offers ready-to-use, cloud-based applications managed by the service provider.

3. What is meant by the scalability of a cloud platform?

    Correct Answer: a. Scalability refers to the cloud platform's ability to increase or decrease resources and services according to demand.
    
    Explanation: Scalability is a critical feature of cloud computing, allowing for the flexible allocation of resources to match the changing needs of an application or workload, ensuring cost-efficiency and performance optimization.

4. What is the distinction between horizontal and vertical scaling?

    Correct Answer: d. Horizontal scaling, or scaling out/in, involves adding more machines or instances to a pool to handle load, while vertical scaling, or scaling up/down, involves adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine.
    
    Explanation: Horizontal scaling enhances capacity by connecting multiple hardware or software entities so that they work as a single logical unit, whereas vertical scaling increases the capacity of a single entity, such as a server, by adding more resources.

5. How do virtual machines differ from containers?

    Correct Answer: b. A virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system that provides a complete system virtualization, while a container offers a lighter-weight, more efficient form of virtualization that packages and isolates applications with their entire runtime environment.
    
    Explanation: VMs include the full copy of an operating system, a virtual copy of all the hardware that the OS requires to run, making them more resource-intensive. Containers share the host systemâ€™s kernel and isolate the application processes from the rest of the system, making them more efficient and faster to start.

6. What are the three primary steps to execute Terraform?

    Correct Answer: a. terraform init to initialize the working directory, terraform plan to create an execution plan, and terraform apply to apply the changes specified by the plan.
    
    Explanation: The terraform init command is used to prepare your project for Terraform operations, initializing various settings and data that will be used by subsequent commands. terraform plan generates a speculative execution plan, showing what actions Terraform will take to change the infrastructure. terraform apply executes the actions proposed in a Terraform plan.

7. What is the difference between terraform plan and terraform apply?

    Correct Answer: a. terraform plan generates a preview of the changes expected without applying them, while terraform apply actually implements the changes in the infrastructure.
    
    Explanation: terraform plan is useful for verifying the changes before making them, allowing for adjustments if necessary. terraform apply makes the proposed changes, altering the actual infrastructure.

8. How do terraform apply and terraform destroy contrast?

    Correct Answer: a. terraform apply is used to create or update resources according to the Terraform configuration, whereas terraform destroy is used to remove all the resources defined in the Terraform configuration.
    
    Explanation: While terraform apply changes the infrastructure to match the desired state described in the configuration files, terraform destroy removes all resources, effectively tearing down the managed infrastructure.

9. What distinguishes terraform apply from terraform refresh?

    Correct Answer: a. terraform apply makes changes to the infrastructure as per the configuration, while terraform refresh updates the state file with the actual state of the resources in the infrastructure without making any changes.
    
    Explanation: terraform refresh is used to reconcile the state Terraform knows about (stored in the state file) with the real-world infrastructure, ensuring the state file accurately reflects the current resources but does not modify the infrastructure.
