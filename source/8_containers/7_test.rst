Testing the containers can be split into 2 categories: 

- **functional** - making sure that code works
- **business** - making sure that it does what is supposed to do. 

==================
Functional testing
==================

Functional testing is the process of testing the functionality of a software application. It is a type of black-box testing that is performed to verify that the application under test is working as expected. Functional testing involves testing the application against the functional requirements/specifications.

Validating the structure and configuration of container images is an essential step to ensure that they are built correctly and securely. Here are some methods and tools you can use to validate your container images:

1. ``Lint`` Dockerfile: Use a linter tool like ``hadolint`` to check your Dockerfile for best practices and common issues. This can help you catch potential problems before building the image.
2. Analyze image ``layers``: Use tools like ``dive`` or ``Docker Desktop`` to inspect the layers of your container image. This can help you identify unnecessary files or dependencies that could be removed to reduce the image size.
3. Check for ``vulnerabilities``: Scan your container image for known vulnerabilities using tools like ``clair``, ``trivy``, or ``anchore``. These tools can help you identify and fix security issues in your images.
4. Verify image ``metadata``: Inspect the image metadata, such as labels, environment variables, and exposed ports, using the ``docker inspect`` command. This can help you verify that the image is configured correctly.
5. Test image ``configurations``: Test the configurations of your container image by running it with various environment variables, command-line arguments, or configuration files. This can help you ensure that your container behaves correctly under different settings.
6. Use configuration management tools: Tools like ``Ansible``, ``Chef``, or ``Puppet`` can help you manage your container configurations and ensure that they are consistent across your environment.
7. ``Validate`` container runtime settings: Test your container with different runtime settings, such as resource limits, network configurations, and storage options, to ensure that it works correctly in various environments.
8. ``Test`` container orchestration: If you're using an orchestration platform like Kubernetes, make sure to validate your container configurations in that environment. Use tools like ``docker``, ``kubectl``, ``helm``, or ``kustomize`` to manage and test your container configurations.
9. Implement ``continuous integration`` (CI): Set up a CI pipeline to automatically build, test, and validate your container images whenever changes are made to the codebase or configurations. Tools like ``Jenkins``, ``GitLab CI/CD``, and ``GitHub Actions`` can help automate the process.
10. ``Monitor and log container behavior``: Use monitoring and logging tools like ``Prometheus``, ``Grafana``, ``Elasticsearch``, or ``Fluentd`` to track the behavior of your containers in production. This can help you identify and address any issues related to the structure and configuration of your container images.

Business testing
================

Business testing is the process of testing the business requirements of a software application. It is a type of black-box testing that is performed to verify that the application under test is working as expected. Business testing involves testing the application against the business requirements/specifications.
