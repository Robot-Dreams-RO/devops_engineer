.. note::

   A good DevOps is a jack of all trades and a master of one. 

To be an efficient engineer you need to understand:

   #. types of available environments, what are the differences, how to use them, and when to use them: bare metals, virtual machines, pods, containers, and cloud.
   #. administer, manage, debug, and use Linux and Terminal
   #. work in a team, share, and version the code using git
   #. write easy to use the documentation
   #. automate your work using scripting and coding
   #. test and understand where could problems appear
   #. question the status quo and try to improve everything around you: security, scalability, resilience, performance
