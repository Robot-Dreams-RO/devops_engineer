9.5 Docker Swarm vs Kubernetes
##############################

Docker Swarm and Kubernetes are both container orchestration systems, which means they are used to manage and scale containerized applications. However, there are some key differences between the two:

#. **Architecture**: Docker Swarm is a simple and easy-to-use orchestration system that is built on top of Docker. It uses a single manager node and multiple worker nodes to manage and schedule containers. On the other hand, Kubernetes is a more complex and powerful orchestration system that uses a master-slave architecture, with multiple master and worker nodes that work together to manage and schedule containers.

#. **Scalability**: Kubernetes is designed to handle large-scale deployments and can handle thousands of containers, while Docker Swarm is more limited and is typically used for smaller deployments.

#. **Flexibility**: Kubernetes is more flexible and can run on a variety of platforms, including on-premises, in the cloud, and in hybrid environments. Docker Swarm is more limited and is typically used for deployments in a single environment.

#. **Features**: Kubernetes has a more extensive set of features and built-in capabilities, such as self-healing, automatic scaling, and rolling updates. Docker Swarm has a more limited set of features, but it can be extended through the use of third-party tools.

#. **Community**: Kubernetes has a larger and more active community, with more contributors and a larger number of third-party tools and services available. Docker Swarm has a smaller community, but it is still actively developed and supported.


.. note::

    TL;DR

    Docker Swarm is for small projects and Kubernetes is for large projects.
